Description: v7.x upgrade instructions
 With the 7.x release the Loki storage server requires a new "lmq-port" option
 to be added to the configuration file before the storage server will start.
 This package contains a script to help you do this for a multi-sn setup; after
 installation run:
 .
     sudo loki-multi-sn-upgrade
 .
 which will automatically add lmq-port=202XX options to any existing
 /etc/loki/storage-XX.conf files.  You should only have to do this once.
