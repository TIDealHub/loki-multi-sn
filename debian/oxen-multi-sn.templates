Description: Oxen rebrand upgrade instructions
 CRITICAL NOTICE
 .
 With the 8.1.5 oxen rebrand release the oxend configuration files need to be moved from
 /etc/loki/node-*.conf to /etc/oxen/node-*.conf, and the system services under the new
 oxen-node@XX.service aliases need to be activated.
 .
 This can typically be done for you by running:
 .
     sudo oxen-multi-sn-upgrade
 .
 after package upgrades finish.
