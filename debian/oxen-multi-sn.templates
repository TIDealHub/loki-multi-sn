Description: oxen rebrand upgrade instructions
 With the 8.1.5 oxen rebrand release the oxend configuration files need to be moved from
 /etc/loki/node-*.conf to /etc/oxen/node-*.conf.
 .
 This can typically be done for you by running:
 .
     sudo oxen-multi-sn-upgrade
 .
 after package upgrade finishes (or alternatively you can move the files yourself).
